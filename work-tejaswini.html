            <h1>University Sector Algorithms</h1>
            <h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm For finding shortest path from University</h2>
            <p><strong>Why Dijkstra's Algorithm?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Dijkstra's algorithm plays a crucial role in finding the shortest path from a fixed source node 
                to a specified target location in a weighted, undirected graph.
            </p>
            <p>
                This code uses Dijkstra's algorithm on an adjacency list representation of a weighted graph to compute the shortest path and distance from a fixed source (UniversityMainGate) to a user-specified target location, enabling efficient navigation in the given network.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></p>  
            <ul>  
                <li><strong>Graph Representation:</strong> The university's locations and connections are represented as a weighted graph using an adjacency list.</li>  
                <li><strong>Shortest Path Calculation:</strong> Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to compute the shortest path from the fixed source (<code>UniversityMainGate</code>) to the target location, minimizing the total distance.</li>  
                <li><strong>Path Reconstruction:</strong> Using the array, the algorithm reconstructs the optimal path from the source to the target, skipping unnecessary nodes.</li>  
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The approach handles arbitrary node connections and edge weights, allowing for a general-purpose navigation system.</li>
                <li>It works with any type of graph connections and distances, making it adaptable to various navigation needs.</li>
                <li> The algorithm efficiently computes the shortest paths using the priority queue.</li>
            </ul>

              <h2>Prim's Algorithm For Connecting Parking Lots</h2>
            <p><strong>Why Prim's Algorithm?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph. The MST is a subset of the edges that connects all the nodes with the minimum possible total weight, without forming any cycle
            </p>

            </p>
           <p><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></p>  
<ul>  
<li><strong>Graph Representation:</strong> The parking lots (nodes) and roads (edges) are represented as a weighted graph using an adjacency list, where each edge has a distance (weight) between two parking lots.</li>  
<li><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Calculation:</strong> Prim's algorithm is employed to compute the minimum spanning tree (MST) by selecting the least costly edge at each step, ensuring all parking lots are connected with the minimal total distance.</li>  
<li><strong>Cost Calculation:</strong> Using a priority queue (min-heap), the algorithm adds the cheapest edge to the MST, updating the total cost and ensuring the optimal connection of all parking lots without forming cycles.</li>

</ul>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Prim's algorithm ensures that all parking lots are connected with the minimum possible total distance, avoiding unnecessary paths and reducing travel costs.</li>
                <li>Prim's algorithm is easy to implement and understand, making it an accessible choice for solving problems involving optimal connectivity in graphs like parking lot networks</li>
                <li> Easy to implement and understand, especially for common navigation problems.</li>
            </ul>
                        <h2>Quick Sort for Exam HallAllocation Based on USN</h2>
            <p><strong>Why Quick Sort?</strong></p>
            <p>
Quick Sort is a highly efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements.            </p>

            </p>
           <p><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></p>  
<ul>  
<li><strong>Sorting the USNs:</strong> Quick Sort is used to sort the students' USNs in ascending order, ensuring that students are allocated to exam halls in a consistent and predictable sequence.</li>  
<li><strong>Efficient Allocation:</strong> By sorting the students, the allocation process becomes systematic, where students with smaller USNs are allocated first, optimizing the allocation process across multiple exam halls.</li>  
<li><strong>Order Preservation:</strong> Quick Sort ensures that the students are assigned to halls in a sorted order, maintaining clarity and consistency in the allocation process.</li>
</ul>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>  Quick Sort provides a structured and predictable order for allocating students to exam halls, ensuring efficient and orderly allocation.</li>
                <li>By sorting students in \(O(n \log n)\) time, Quick Sort enables faster and more efficient allocation, especially for large numbers of students.</li>
                <li>  Quick Sort's efficiency makes it suitable for handling large datasets of students, enabling the program to scale well as the number of students or exam halls increases.</li>
            </ul>
